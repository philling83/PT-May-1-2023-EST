# Practice: CSS Colors, Borders, and Shadows

Now, it's time to practice your understanding of the
**CSS: Colors, Borders, and Shadows**.

## Set up

1. Clone the practice from the starter.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` after completing each phase.

Once you're in VS Code, you can drag the __index.html__ file into your browser
to view the webpage, or use the **File Explorer** to open it in your browser.
The only file you will need to edit for this practice is __main.css__.

> Remember to save the CSS file and refresh the page in the browser whenever you
> make changes.

## Background and Context

You will begin with a web page that has all of the HTML and a little CSS
completed. You only need to add to the CSS to complete each phase.

After completing each phase, you can run the Cypress tests to confirm that you
applied the correct styling. Keep in mind that often **there are many ways to
accomplish the same goal with CSS**. The Cypress tests only evaluate the final
output, but does not evaluate the approach you took to get to the output. Feel
free to refactor your CSS and try multiple approaches!

## Phase 1 - Borders

The first step is to add borders around two boxes. The first box will have a
border that is:

1. width of 5px
2. blue
3. solid

The second step box should be given a border that is:

1. dotted
2. red
3. width of 2px
4. rounded edges by 5px

## Phase 2 - Colors

Now, it's time to explore the `color` property.

First, change the `color` of the first text to `#FFC300`.
You can also try different hexadecimal color options to see how it affects
the text.

Next, use the rgb property to change the `color` of the second text.

Set the rgb of the text `color` to (235, 62, 71).

Finally, the box's text will be easier to read with the set `background-color`.

## Phase 3 - Opacity

Now, you can turn your attention to the opacity of Box 3.

The first step is to change the `background-color` of the box using the rgba
properties. Change the opacity of the box to 0.6.

Afterward, you can also manipulate the text's opacity by changing every h2's
opacity to 0.5 for additional practice.

## Phase 4 - Shadows

Next, add box shadows to boxes 5 and 6.

Box 5 requires a box shadow with:

1. 20px beneath it
2. 8px to the right
3. a blur-radius of 15px
4. a teal shadow

Box 6 requires a shadow with:

1. 5px to the right
2. 10px above
3. a color of `#800000`

You have learned how to manipulate common CSS properties to add special
features to your projects. Run the tests one more time to make sure everything has the correct styling.

## What you've learned

Congratulations! You have successfully practiced the core styles associated
with the **CSS: Colors, Borders, and Shadows**. This includes setting

* `rgb`
* `border`
* `color`
* `background-color`
* `rgba`
* `opacity`
* `box-shadow`
