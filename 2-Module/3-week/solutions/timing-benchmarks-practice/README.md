# Practice Timing Benchmarks

In this three-phase exercise, you will be implementing a few simple JavaScript
functions, then testing them at _massive_ scale.

## Goals

* Practice for-loop fundamentals
* Get comfortable with large _n_ values
* Practice timing code with `Date.now()` and `console.time()`
* Record and display timing results on a Google Sheet
* Identify and prove that code is O(1), O(n) or O(n^2)

## Setup

1. Clone the starter repo at [starter]
2. Install all packages with `npm install`

## Phases

1. Implementation - Implement the code you will be testing in the other phases
2. Scale testing harness - Testing your code for a variety of inputs
3. Timing your code - Measure the time it takes to run with various input sizes
