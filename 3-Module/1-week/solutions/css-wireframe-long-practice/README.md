# Basic CSS Wireframe Long Practice

In this practice you will be using CSS to style the HTML that you have
identified from the wireframe.

## Set up

You can choose to use the HTML that you or your pair created in the HTML
Wireframe practice, or use the one provided in this [starter].

## Instructions

Your main focus is to replicate the styling for components (button, links,
paragraphs, headings, font-family, lists, grid) from scratch, based on the
wireframe specs.

The project should look similar to the example images below.

Tip: Use the [lorem ipsum generator][lorem] to get lorem ipsum text used in the
wireframe

Get the JS image [here][jsimage].

Bonus: Add a grid that contains at least 4 elements at the end of your article
as seen on the example below.

Bonus: Add CSS effects to your elements, like a color change when you hover over
a button or a shadow effect to the nav bar.
