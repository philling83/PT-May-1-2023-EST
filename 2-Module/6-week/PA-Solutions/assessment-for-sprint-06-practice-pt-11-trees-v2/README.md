# Finding the largest value node at each level

Your objective is to find the node with the highest value at each level of a
binary tree.

You will be provided with a solution that almost works, but not quite. Your job is to debug the provided solution and make all of the local test cases and test specs pass.

1. Clone the assessment repository from the starter.
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. Fill out code in `tree_practice.js`
4. Uncomment the marked code and run `node tree_practice.js` to run local test
   cases
5. `npm test` to run the test specs

## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. Re-run all unit tests and fix any syntax errors that are crashing the tests. If
the unit tests crash, or do not run, you will receive a zero for the coding
portion of the assessment
2. Delete the `node_modules` directory
3. Zip up your folder
4. Upload it
