# Practice: `data-` Attributes on HTML Elements

In this practice, you will be explore the `data-` attribute on HTML elements.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

## Instructions

You are provided an __index.html__ file with a basic form set up to add items
to a shopping list.

The form consists of a `#name` `<input>` field, representing the name of the
list item, as well as a `#type` `<select>` field representing the category the
item belongs to. The `#add` button to add the item to the list is currently
non-functional.

Complete the following tasks in __data.js__ and __index.css__ files provided
to you:

- Create an event listener for the `#add` button to add items to the list.
- Display the items in the `#shopping-list` `<ul>` element.
- Set the `data-type` attribute of each `<li>` element with the value of the
  `type` field.
- For each type, style the `<li>` a different background color in __index.css__.
  Recall that CSS supports attribute selectors using square brackets.
