                <h2>Feathers in the Wind</h2>
                <p><em>A retelling of a European Jewish wisdom tale.</em></p>

                <p>Once there was a man whom the entire village knew to be a gossip.
                    He could not wait to share the juiciest piece of gossip with
                    whoever would listen. It did not matter to him if the stories he
                    spread were true, or notâ€”he never stopped to ask.</p>
                <p>One day, after hearing the rabbi speak about the harm gossip
                    causes, this man went to the rabbi and said, "Rabbi, I am truly
                    sorry for all the pain I have caused with my loose lips. I
                    repent and will gossip no more. Can I be forgiven?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," replied the rabbi, "but here is what you must do. Go home.
                    Find a feather pillow. Open the pillow and release the feathers
                    on the wind. Then, come back to me."</p>
                <p>The man thought this a strange request, but he did as he was
                    told. When he came back, the rabbi said, "Now, go gather all the
                    feathers released from the pillow."</p>
                <p>"But that is impossible! They have flown all over the place. I do
                    not even know where most of them have traveled!"</p>
                <p>"So it is with words: you do know where your gossip and rumors
                    have traveled. Once words have been uttered, they cannot be
                    taken back."</p>
                <p>The man understood. From that day on, he was careful and
                    thoughtful when speaking of others, and spoke with
                    integrity.</p>
