# Practice: CSS Linking and Imports

Now, it's time to practice your understanding of the **CSS: Linking**.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

Once you've in VS Code, you can drag the __index.html__ file into your browser
to view the webpage, or use the **File Explorer** to open it in your browser.
The only file you will need to edit for this practice is __main.css__.

> Remember to save the CSS file and refresh the page in the browser whenever you
> make changes.

## Background and Context

You will begin with a web page that has all of the HTML and a little CSS
completed. You only need to add to the CSS to complete each phase.

## Phase 1 - Link the CSS

The first step is to:

1. Link both the __button.css__ file and the __styles.css__ files to the
   __index.html__ file to add some color to this page!

Once you get that to work, and display the styles correctly on the page,
refactor your code to:

2. Create an __import.css__ file. Use the `@import` keyword to import the
   __styles.css__ file and the __button.css__ file. Then link the __import.css__
   file to your __index.html__.

It is good practice to try both to familarize yourself with the two methods of
linking stylesheets.

## What you've learned

Congratulations! You have successfully practiced how to link your CSS to your
HTML files.
