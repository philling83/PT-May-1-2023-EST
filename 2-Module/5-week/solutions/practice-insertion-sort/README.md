# Practice: Insertion Sort

In this practice, you will be implementing an insertion sort based on the
pseudocode provided to you.

## Set Up

Clone practice from the [starter].

Install all packages by running `npm install`

Read through all the instructions and specs to understand the task.

Run test specs with `npm test`

## Polya's Problem Solving

Remember Polya's problem solving framework as you go through these exercises.

1. Understand the problem
2. Make a plan
3. Carry out the plan
4. Look back and improve your solution

You will be implementing classic algorithms in code. Review the readings to
_understand the problem_.

You are given the _plan_ in comments already. Study these carefully!

These exercises are meant for you to practice _carrying out the plan_. Focus
on translating the plans to JavaScript code.

If you finish early, you will be able to _improve your solutions_ by
refactoring your sorting algorithms to run in-place.

## Instructions

Read through the pseudo-code in the __insertion-sort.js__ file to implement
insertion sort.

This exercise makes use of `console.log` to make sure that your implementations
of insertion sort is correct. Note each intermediate state of the arrays in
__test/sort-specs.js__.

If you follow the pseudocode, your `console.log` outputs will match the order
in the specs.

## Bonus

Time and plot the performance of your implementations on a Google Sheet.
