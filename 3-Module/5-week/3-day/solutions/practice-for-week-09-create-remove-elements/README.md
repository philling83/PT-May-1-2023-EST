# Practice: Create and Remove Elements

In this practice, you will create and remove HTML elements from the HTML
document.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

## Instructions

You are given an HTML file, __index.html__ with some interactive buttons
on the HTML page. These buttons should trigger the page to display or remove
images from the page. Right now, the buttons will not do anything when
clicked.

Your job is to fill in the code in the given script file, __create-remove.js__
to cause images to be added and removed from the HTML page when these buttons
are clicked.

Some code will be written for you, so all you'll need to do is fill in code
where indicated. An example image element along with CSS styles is provided to
serve as a guide for you.
