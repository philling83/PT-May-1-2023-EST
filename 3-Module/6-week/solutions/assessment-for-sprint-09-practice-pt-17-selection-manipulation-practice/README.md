# Selection and Manipulation of DOM Elements Practice

In this project, you will demonstrate your ability to select specific DOM
elements using a variety of strategies, and then manipulate those elements in a
variety of ways.

## The tasks

You are provided with an **index.html** file and a **site.css** file. Do not
modify any of the code in these files, or you will fail the tests. You may only
work in the **your-code.js** file.

Open the **your-code.js** file in VSCode. You will complete eight selection and
manipulation tasks which are listed in that file. For each task, you are given
instructions to select a given element, and then manipulate it in a specific
way.

When you refresh the **index.html** page in the browser, you should see your
changes rendered on the screen. A screenshot is provided at the bottom of the
page to show your target solution. Note that there may be differences in overall
size and position of the boxes depending on your browser and screen size. 

## Testing with Cypress

This installation will take a long time! While you are waiting for the
installation, follow the directions above.

Run `npm install` to install the Cypress testing library.

For Ubuntu/Linux/WSL users, you may have to update your environment to support
Cypress. Based on the [docs for Cypress environment dependencies], run the
following commands to make sure your environment is up to date.

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb
```

Run `npm test` to make sure you pass all the test specs.
