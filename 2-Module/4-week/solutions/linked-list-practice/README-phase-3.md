# Practice Linked Lists Phase 3 - Comparing performance

In this phase, your task is to compare the performance between a singly and
doubly linked lists which you implemented in phases 1 and 2.

Continue working in same the [starter] repo as phases 1 and 2.

## Directions

Identify the time complexity of `addToHead` and `addToTail` for both the
single and doubly linked lists.

Construct a timing test in **linked-list-timing.js** to verify your hypothesis.

There are no test specs for this phase.
