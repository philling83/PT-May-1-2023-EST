# Practice: Element Selection

In this practice, you will practice selecting HTML elements using methods on the
`window` object in the browser.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

## Instructions

There is an HTML document, __index.html__ and an embedded JavaScript file,
__selectors.js__. Within the script file, there are various elements or
groups of elements that you need to find and select from the HTML document.

Your job is to write the selector queries that will return the indicated
element(s). Keep in mind there can be multiple ways to get the same result!
Results can be either `NodeList`s, `HTMLCollection`s, `Array`s, or individual
HTML elements.

`console.log` your results and open the "Console" tab in your browser's
Developer Tools to verify your results. Remember to use `debugger` and
`console.log` to help you debug your code.
