function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

let counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // => 1
console.log(counter()); // => 2

//we cannot reach the count variable!
counter.count; // undefined
let counter2 = createCounter();
console.log(counter2()); // => 1
```
