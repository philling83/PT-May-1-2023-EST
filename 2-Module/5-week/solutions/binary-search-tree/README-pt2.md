# Practice: Binary Search Tree - Part 2

In this exercise, you will be implementing search in a basic binary search
tree.

## Setup

1. Continue working from the same starter as part 1
2. Read the instructions and test specs to understand the problem
3. Fill out the code until tests are all green

## Part 2: Binary Search Tree search

Now that you can build valid binary search trees, you can implement the
`search` method.

`search(val)` should return `true` if the value is in the tree and `false` if
it is not.

```plaintext
  4
 / \
3   5
```

For example, in the tree pictured above, `bst.search(3)` would return `true`
and `bst.search(6)` would return false.

Read through the specs in `test/binary-search-tree-spec.js` for more details.
