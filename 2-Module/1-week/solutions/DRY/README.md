# Practice: Making Code DRY

In this practice, you will use the DRY principle to abstract a pattern into a
helper function.

## Set Up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Directions

You will find four functions in the file __practice.js__. If you run `npm test`
now, you should see all the specs testing those four functions passing. Your job
is to look at the four functions and identify where you may be able to refactor
by creating a **single** helper function that is used in **all four** functions to help DRY
this code.

When you are sure that you have successfully refactored the code, run `npm test`
to see if the functions still return the correct information by making sure all
the test specs still pass.
